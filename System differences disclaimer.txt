Outputs of GCAM may vary slightly depending on the computer systems on which scenarios are run. 
The GCAM solution process at a given timestep iterates until all markets clear within the defined 
solution tolerance, which is set to 0.1%. Different operating systems, operating system versions, 
C++ libraries, and C++ compilers may affect this solution process and arrive within the solution 
tolerance in different numbers of iterations, resulting in different model outputs for the same 
scenario configuration run on different computers. The vast majority of model outputs differ by 
far less than the solution tolerance, though it is possible for some model outputs to differ between 
scenarios by more than the solution tolerance. There are several reasons for this: 1) Only a subset 
of model outputs are from solved markets – other output values are mathematically related to the 
solved market quantities and prices, but aren’t directly solved for, and so aren’t directly governed 
by the solution tolerance; and 2) GCAM is a recursive model, meaning each timestep depends on the 
solution to the previous timestep, so differences in early timesteps can amplify by the final model 
year.
